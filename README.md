### I Am going to tell you a story

**This my old style work**
~~When I was young did have a electronic writting That I could delete put more or less info, I just had to scrable all. I quite like the old school when the pen didn't have a ink and we have to comunicate in person for ask borrow pen.~~
All this scrable before I wrote is  because we are humans, that we born making mistakes, without them we will still cutting stones with piece of wood. I am one of the passionate generation of tech, that always became a question, how on earth two elecrons tells you a number <sub> then this is when all start</sub>. 
When people sees other works that is not the style  <sup>sorry but you are on the bottom list</sup> then you realised , that the life is beatiful.
